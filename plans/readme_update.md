# README.md Update Plan

## Objective
Update the "Special Thanks & Acknowledgements" section of `README.md` to be more inclusive, global, and recognize a wider range of AI contributors as requested.

## Proposed Changes

Replace the existing "Special Thanks & Acknowledgements" section (lines 176-188) with the following content:

```markdown
### 🌟 Special Thanks & Acknowledgements
*   **The Rust Team**: For the language that makes this possible.
*   **VSCode Team**: For the editor environment.
*   **Google DeepMind & The Gemini Team (Worldwide)**: For the intelligence powering the agent (`gemini-3-pro-preview`).
*   **Linux & Git**: For the foundation of our workflow.
*   **Open Source Community**: Special thanks to the authors of `ratatui`, `tokio`, `portable-pty`, `serde`, `clap`, `lancedb`, and all other dependencies used in this project.

**Global AI Innovations:**
We acknowledge the global community of researchers and engineers advancing the frontier of intelligence:

*   **OpenAI**: Creators of ChatGPT.
*   **Anthropic**: Creators of Claude and Constitutional AI.
*   **DeepSeek**: Pushing boundaries in efficient AI and coding.
*   **Meta AI**: For Llama and open research.
*   **Hugging Face**: The democratizing force of the AI community.
*   **Zhipu AI**: Creators of the GLM (General Language Model) series.
*   **Moonshot AI**: For Kimi and long-context breakthroughs.
*   **Minimax**: For creators of Minimax M2.1 and free usage

```
## Reason for Changes
- **Inclusivity**: explicitly naming major Asian and Middle Eastern labs.
- **Global Context**: Removing specific country labels (e.g., "United States", "China") to emphasize the global nature of the scientific community rather than geopolitical borders.
- **Accuracy**: Updating Google credit to "Google DeepMind" and "Worldwide".
